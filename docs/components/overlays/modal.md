# Modal 

Use the modal component to show interactive dialogs
and notifications to your website users
available in multiple sizes, colors, and styles

The modal component can be used as an interactive dialog
on top of the main content area of the website
to show notifications and gather information
using form elements from your website users.

## Examples

<SContainer>
  <SModal/>
</SContainer>

<<< @/.vitepress/components/modal/SModal.vue

## Size

You can use four different modal sizing options starting from small to extra large, but keep in mind that the width of these modals will remain the same when browsing on smaller devices.

`xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `2xl`, `3xl`, `4xl`, `5xl`, `6xl`, `7xl`

The default value is: `2xl`
